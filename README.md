# Math-Game
This C++ console game allows users to answer randomly generated math questions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) at different difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, Mix). It tracks correct and incorrect answers, displays feedback with color, and shows the final result at the end.
